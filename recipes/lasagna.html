    <h3>Description</h3>
    </p>
    <p>Lasagna , also known as lasagne , is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat
        sheets. In Italian cuisine it is made of stacked layers of pasta alternating with fillings such as ragu,
        bechamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which
        melts during baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven.
        The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato
            paste.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian
            seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How long it takes to cook?</h3>
    </p>
    <p>The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with
        foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important to let
        the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.</p>
